## [Attendance System](https://abs.aaronlee.live)
[this link might be dead because I'm not actively maintaining it]
{{< carousel "/static/img/projects.md/attendance" >}}
I made our school's shiny new online attendance system with the help of my homeroom teacher to replace the old paper-based system. It was used for about half a semester stably but was later dropped because the school's IT department decided the services this utilized was not suitable to our school's infrastructure. It is now [open-sourced here](https://github.com/aaronleetw/Attendance). I also created a much more robust [version 2](https://github.com/aaronleetw/Attendance/tree/v2) with MySQL, but was never presented.
